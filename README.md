# Hearing_test_matlab_GUI

The Matlab Files here generate a GUI where one can take a hearing test and after the test it shows an audiogaram as the result.

**Headphones are necessary for the test**

The test is in 3 parts. For left, right and both ears.

**The Testing System:**
1. After the test starts, the system generates a sound with decreasing amplitude and tells the test taker 
to click a button when he or she cannot hear it anymore. The system then notes the response.

2. Step 1 is repeated for a set of frequencies and with all the responses noted, the system 
shows a plot as the result. The Plot is of Frequencies against Sound Hearing Level in dB.

3. Three times steps 1 and 2 are repeated for left, right and both ears respectively.

"Hearing_test_Matlab_GUI", is the first version. "Final_edited_Hearing_test", is the updated version of the system.
